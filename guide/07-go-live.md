Following directly after Cutover, the practice ‘Sign off’ the Go-Live data, and commences the beginning of the new supplier’s solution. 

* The old solution is now read only and available for another 45 days as standard - **check this with your old supplier to ensure that they do not terminate access early.**

* Third party solutions should come back online.

### Sign off Go Live Data 

On Go-Live day there will be data checking activities that you need to complete. If the practice is satisfied that all the data has been transferred and the migration is successful, sign off the live data and provide confirmation to the Supplier 

### Switch links back on and notify 3rd parties

Now your new solution is up and running you can contact all the connecting solutions and community services that the system/solution or the practice works with, to switch services back on, for example:

* Third party software/solution suppliers, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management.

* Complete the registration process for patients that joined the practice during the Cutover period

If you use any third party software as part of your solution, please be aware that reconfiguration work may be required by them now that the practice has migrated to the new clinical solution.


### Data re-checking

The practice should re-check the patients identified and tested previously as part of the [initial data production](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production) as well as random patients. 

Practice staff should recheck reports such as QOF and indicator points, cytology and immunisation target reports, capitation figures and the remapping of local codes.


### Training on the new solution

Practice staff may have already received [training for the new solution](/prm-practice-migration/guide/training) or may receive it during the Cut-over period, including training for any changes to practice processes.  

## What to look out for

 * Confirm your Go-Live date with the new supplier again to make sure there is no change in their schedules.  

* Each practice has its own MESH inbox/queue/secure file transfer. When MESH changes, teams need to inform partner services of the change in address.  

* Fixing degraded codes could take the practice some time.
<!-- [UPLIFT] reworded the language here -->

* New patients cannot complete registration until after the Cutoff period so you will need to ask them to come back after Go-Live.

## Process review

As part of your process review, your supplier will submit reports to NHS Digital to help with the continuous improvement of the migration process.

This is likely to include:
<!-- [GAP] include reference to metrics dashboard inputs here -->
* Mapping tables

* Data migration

* Provision of Documented Data Extract

* Hazard Log and Clinical Safety Case

* Issue Logs

* Cut-over timescale
