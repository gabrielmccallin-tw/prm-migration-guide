## The decision to migrate and funding {#decision-to-migrate-and-funding}

When ordering a new system, check that you have thoroughly reviewed the system to ensure that it fully meets your needs. You may incur penalty charges if you decide to cancel a migration after the order has been placed. 

This guide begins from the point at which the CCG has approved the practiceâ€™s request to change their current system and is ready to start the migration process.

Note: This is subject to the conditions described in the [CCG-Practice Agreement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/terms-governing-the-provision-and-receipt-of-gpsoc-services-and-gp-it-services/)) 

Prior to this, there are a number of steps that will have taken place, such as:
* Completion of a selection process under the GP IT Futures framework
* Completion of a [business justification template](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/business-justification-guidance-for-change-of-gp-it-futures-foundation-solution-template/) for a change of GP IT Future foundation solution
* Confirmation and approval of funding by CCGs (and any local boards) for both the migration and any associated costs such as training and core hardware/software upgrades
-- _Note: there may be [further costs identified by the Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) for replacing hardware and setting up additional third party configuration_
* Engagement of practice and CCG with their delivery partner to secure support and management of the migration process in line with the GP IT Operating Model

Once the decision to migrate has been confirmed, the next steps are to:

### Agree a provisional Go Live date

A provisional Go-Live date should be agreed between the practice and supporting functions - usually the CCG and/or delivery partner.

Ideally the provisional date should be agreed with the new system supplier prior to placing the order.

#### Order the new solution

The CCG or GP IT delivery partner (or local alternative) places the order using the agreed GP IT Futures process (to be confirmed).

* CCG approves the order (this should then be sent to the supplier)
* The new supplier receives and accepts the order (once done then a schedule of key dates should be obtained for discussion at the Kick-off meeting)


### Arrange your Kick-off and Technical Survey

Plan and book the [Kick-off meeting](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off) that should include all key people who will be involved in the migration process (refer to list in the Kick-off section). Decide when to set up the [Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) shortly after the Kick-off meeting has taken place. Some delivery partners conduct Technical Surveys remotely and do not necessarily need to be on site.
