#### Has your current supplier provided a extract of the patient data to the new supplier?

* [Check that a request has been made and dates agreed](/prm-practice-migration/guide/get-started#request-data-extract)

#### Do you have a list of patient records for testing/data checking?

* Has the [new supplier provided a set of test criteria](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#data-checking-prep) for identifying which patient records to test?

* Have you used the criteria to identify patient records that match the criteria?

* [Do you know how to report issues to the new supplier, should you find issues with the data/patient records?](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production#reporting-issues-with-data)
<!-- [GAP] Needs rewording; will be based on new process -->

* Once all issues have been addressed, are you able to [‘sign off’ that the data is accurate and the practice is satisfied with the quality of the data?](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production#signing-off-the-data-checking)
