The practice completes a business case providing reasons to justify the migration and detailing the preferred clinical system (otherwise known as a solution). This is assessed by the CCG and if approved, they will authorise the funding to support the migration.

**Note:** there may be [further costs identified by the Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) for replacing hardware and paying for additional third party configurations. These should be considered by the CCG as quickly as possible to ensure availability of funding in line with the timing of the migration.
